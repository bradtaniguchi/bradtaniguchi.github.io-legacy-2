# intercept-game

This project is a remake of the Milton Bradley game Dogfight. It uses Angular and was built with focus on TDD and functional programming, along with some more "fancy" TS approaches/features I wanted to play around with

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/intercept-game)

At the time of writing there is no deployment of the project **yet**. I'll hopefully come back and update this post with the link :)
