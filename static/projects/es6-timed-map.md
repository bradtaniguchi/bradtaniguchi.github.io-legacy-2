# es6-timed-map

An es6-map-like utility library with time based functions and support. Created primarily for hacktoberfest 2020, and learning how to create TypeScript based multi-platform libraries. This library is still under development, and will be used for hacktoberfest 2021 aswell. Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/es6-timed-map)
