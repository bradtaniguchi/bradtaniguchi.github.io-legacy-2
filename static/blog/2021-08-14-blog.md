# Building a github-template repo

I am not one to use different technologies, beyond the ones I already have a lot of experience with. Mainly because I'd rather build what I want, rather than focus on 
how its built. This is why I generally almost always use the MEAN stack using nx. Because of this I really should of been using github's repo template feature this whole time.
As it should allow me to get going faster, without worrying about getting all the same stuff I always get.

So here is my current WIP "nx-workspace-template" repo:
