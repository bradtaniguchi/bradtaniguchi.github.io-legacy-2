# Clojure Learning Update

Yesterday I was using repl.it as my "cloud editor" for learning clojure. I wasn't trying to do much more than get an online clojure REPL I can use on my Pixelbook. Repl.it worked well, but I think its time I start working with more powerful tooling. Namely VSCode and Clava. 

To help with this, while also allowing me to still use my Pixelbook I'll be looking to migrate to codespaces on github. 

happy coding!
