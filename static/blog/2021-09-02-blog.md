# 2021-09-02-blog

I realized the last actual time off I took was **before the pandemic**, which might
explain why I've been feeling rather burnt out as of late. I did take off 2 days
since then, but 1 of those was for moving.

Because of all this I finally took a last minute day off before the labor day weekend to help
recoup. I'll probably be spending it learning more about clojure, or just taking it easy beyond
tending to some personal things. Hopefully by next week I'll be feeling much
more energized!
