# UTF-8 vs UTF-16

I don't remember the last time a bug like this has ruined my day, but this issue was a great reminder about "hidden characters", text encoding and the disadvantages of copy-pasting.

## The background

As part of learning how to build a github-page with all the bells and whistles, I wanted to add lighthouse testing to the mix. Specifically adding this [github action](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action):

```
treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v7
```

This github-action should of been as easy as adding it to the existing workflow file I have, and optionally adding 2 extra files, a budget file, and an rc file.
All examples revolved around these 2 files and its configuration within the workflow file. At a glance I ~~wrongly~~ assumed this would take under 10 minutes of work to get some basic lighthouse testing up and running.

The processed ended up taking multiple hours, included a walk to help clear my brain, multiple profanities, a whole lot of second guessing and a resolution that ultimately didn't feel like a "win" but was one nonetheless.
