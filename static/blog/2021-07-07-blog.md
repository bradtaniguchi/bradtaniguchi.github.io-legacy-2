# UTF-8 vs UTF-16

I don't remember the last time a bug like this has ruined my day, but this issue was a great reminder about "hidden characters", text encoding and the disadvantages of copy-pasting.

## The background

As part of learning how to build a github-page with all the bells and whistles, I wanted to add lighthouse testing to the mix. Specifically adding this [github action](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action):

```
treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v7
```

This github-action should of been as easy as adding it to the existing workflow file I have, and optionally adding 2 extra files, a budget file, and an rc file.
All examples revolved around these 2 files and its configuration within the workflow file. At a glance I ~~wrongly~~ assumed this would take under 10 minutes of work to get some basic lighthouse testing up and running.

The processed ended up taking multiple hours, included a walk to help clear my brain, multiple profanities, a whole lot of second guessing and a resolution that ultimately didn't feel like a "win" but was one nonetheless.

## The problem

The problem started with me trying to be clever and use the [yaml configuration for lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/main/docs/configuration.md), rather than the traditional json format. Because of this I used a a starting JSON file example, and then an online converter to convert the JSON to YAML as **I was lazy at the time**.

The end result was the following text (this was copied directly from the [source](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/bradtaniguchi.github.io/blob/2ab3efef433969f2caaf9b09f91b8cc7294164b8/lighthouserc.yaml)):
```yaml
ci:
  url:
    - http://localhost/
  collect:
    staticDistDir: './public/static'
```

**note** this first version is actually incorrect compared to the final format, which correctly used the `staticDistDir` of `public/client-static`, but this would of given me a different more friendly error than what occured.

From this YAML file, I deployed my to my CI/CD and where I was introduced to this helpful friendly error message:
```
Run treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v2
Action config
  Error: end of the stream or a document separator is expected at line 1, column 4:
      ��c
         ^
```
**note** again, this is copied directly from the [source](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/bradtaniguchi.github.io/runs/3003815331?check_suite_focus=true)

By this point I introduced only 2 new files, and made changes to my CI/CD workflow file. The issue had to be isolated to one of the 2 files, **or** the 2 files are working correctly and what is being loaded/tested by lighthouse is failing. 

**this is where I started to debug.... a lot, and where the trials began....**
