# FCC Markdown Previewer

This is a simple web-app created for a freeCodeCamp project using Angular. It covers the base project requirements set for [the project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer), along with adding extra features such as a basic local-file system to save/edit multiple files. You can use the application right now from [here](https://bradtaniguchi.github.io/fcc-markdown-previewer).

More project details can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/fcc-markdown-previewer).
